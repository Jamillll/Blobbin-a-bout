# Blobbin a'bout

A game created for my collage game dev unit.

This game makes use of OpenGL for graphics rendering with GLFW for window management and GLEW for retrieving the OpenGL function pointers. On top of those I have made use of stb_image and glm for image parsing and openGL maths calculations respectively. To get accurate physics calculations as I think programming an entire physics solver is out of the scope of this project, I made use of the Box2D library which, while complex, gives me a lot of control over the physics.
