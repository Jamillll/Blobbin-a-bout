# Blobbin a'bout

A game created for my collage game dev unit.

This game makes use of a variety of different libraries for game creation, this is because I've decided against using a game engine or even a game framework, both tools I've used before. The list of libraries used is as follows:

GLFW - This is for window management and user input
GLEW - This is for retrieving the OpenGL functions I will be using for graphics rendering
GLM - OpenGL maths libary
Box2D - This is for 2D physics and collision
